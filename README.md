# raytracer

This is a raytracer based on the book
[Raytracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
By implementing the ideas & concepts from the book, I'm teaching myself 
how do raytracers work in practice and what underlying principles and math are
used to create cool looking scenes.
